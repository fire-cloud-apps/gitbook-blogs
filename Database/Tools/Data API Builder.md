</font>

## What is Microsoft Data API Builder?

Microsoft Data API Builder (DAB) is an open-source engine designed to expose Azure databases to client applications and customers with minimal development effort.  It serves as a powerful middleware that automatically generates REST and GraphQL APIs directly from your database schema, eliminating the need for manual API development. 

Unlike traditional API development approaches that require significant backend coding, DAB operates as a lightweight service that sits between your database and client applications. It's platform-agnostic and works across various environments, making it suitable for both cloud and on-premises deployments.  

DAB supports multiple database platforms including SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, providing a unified API layer regardless of your underlying data store.  This versatility makes it an ideal solution for organizations with heterogeneous database environments.

## Business Use Cases with Problem Statements

### Legacy Modernization
*Problem*: Many organizations struggle with modernizing legacy applications that directly connect to databases without proper API layers, creating security risks and maintenance challenges.

*Solution*: DAB provides an immediate API layer over existing SQL Server databases, allowing legacy systems to be gradually modernized while maintaining compatibility with new client applications.

### Rapid Prototyping
*Problem*: Development teams often waste valuable time building basic CRUD APIs during the early stages of application development.

*Solution*: With DAB, teams can instantly generate production-ready APIs from database schemas, accelerating the prototyping phase and allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure.

### Microservices Integration
*Problem*: Creating consistent API interfaces across multiple database-backed services requires significant development effort and introduces inconsistencies.

*Solution*: DAB standardizes API creation across different database technologies, ensuring consistent authentication, authorization, and response formats regardless of the underlying data store.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 1. Hosting and Running Data API Builder in Docker

**Prerequisites**:
- Docker installed
- SQL Server instance running locally
- Sample databases (Northwind, Pub-Sub, Book-Author)

**Step 1: Create configuration file (dap-config.json)**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/databases/data-api-builder/schemas/v1.0/dab-config.schema.json",
  "settings": {
    "cors": {
      "origins": ["*"]
    }
  },
  "database": {
    "connection-string": "Server=localhost;Database=Northwind;User Id=sa;Password=yourStrong(!)Password;",
    "provider": "mssql"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "host": {
      "mode": "development",
      "cors": true,
      "allow-headers": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Run DAB in Docker**
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v $(pwd)/dap-config.json:/app/dap-config.json \
  --name dab-northwind \
  mcr.microsoft.com/azure-databases-data-api-builder:latest
```

**Step 3: Verify operation**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/Customers
```

**Multiple Database Configuration**:
To support multiple databases (Northwind, Pub-Sub, Book-Author), create separate DAB instances:

```bash
# Northwind
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v $(pwd)/northwind-config.json:/app/dap-config.json --name dab-northwind mcr.microsoft.com/azure-databases-data-api-builder:latest

# Pub-Sub
docker run -d -p 5001:5000 -v $(pwd)/pubsub-config.json:/app/dap-config.json --name dab-pubsub mcr.microsoft.com/azure-databases-data-api-builder:latest

# Book-Author
docker run -d -p 5002:5000 -v $(pwd)/bookauthor-config.json:/app/dap-config.json --name dab-bookauthor mcr.microsoft.com/azure-databases-data-api-builder:latest
```

Each configuration file would point to its respective database connection string.

### 2. Authenticating with Custom JWT Token

**Configuration**:
```json
"auth": {
  "provider": "custom",
  "jwt": {
    "issuer": "https://your-auth-server.com",
    "audience": "data-api-builder",
    "keys": [
      {
        "kty": "RSA",
        "use": "sig",
        "kid": "your-key-id",
        "n": "long-base64-encoded-modulus",
        "e": "AQAB"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Authentication Flow**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant Auth as Auth Server
    participant DAB as Data API Builder
    participant DB as Database
    
    C->>Auth: Request Token (credentials)
    Auth-->>C: JWT Token
    C->>DAB: API Request (with JWT)
    DAB->>DAB: Validate Signature & Claims
    alt Valid Token
        DAB->>DAB: Apply Role Mapping
        DAB->>DB: Execute Query
        DB-->>DAB: Results
        DAB-->>C: API Response
    else Invalid Token
        DAB-->>C: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

### 3. Authenticating with AWS Cognito

**Configuration**:
```json
"auth": {
  "provider": "cognito",
  "jwt": {
    "issuer": "https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_yourpoolid",
    "audience": ["your-client-id"],
    "discovery-uri": "https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_yourpoolid/.well-known/openid-configuration"
  }
}
```

**Authentication Flow**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant Cognito as AWS Cognito
    participant DAB as Data API Builder
    participant DB as Database
    
    C->>Cognito: Login Request
    Cognito-->>C: ID Token (JWT)
    C->>DAB: API Request (with JWT)
    DAB->>Cognito: Fetch Public Keys (if needed)
    Cognito-->>DAB: Public Keys
    DAB->>DAB: Validate Token
    alt Valid Token
        DAB->>DAB: Map Cognito Groups to Roles
        DAB->>DB: Execute Query
        DB-->>DAB: Results
        DAB-->>C: API Response
    else Invalid Token
        DAB-->>C: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

### 4. Role-Based API Access

Configure role-based access in dap-config.json:

```json
"entity": {
  "Customers": {
    "source": "Customers",
    "permissions": [
      {
        "role": "admin",
        "actions": ["*"]
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "actions": ["read", "update"],
        "fields": ["CustomerID", "CompanyName", "ContactName"]
      },
      {
        "role": "guest",
        "actions": ["read"],
        "fields": ["CustomerID", "CompanyName"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Map JWT claims to roles using the "role-claim" setting:

```json
"auth": {
  "role-claim": "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role"
}
```

### 5. Performing Simple CRUD Operations

**Create (POST)**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/Customers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"CustomerID": "NEWCO", "CompanyName": "New Company"}'
```

**Read (GET)**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/Customers?filter=Country eq 'USA'
```

**Update (PATCH)**:
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/Customers(NEWCO) \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"ContactName": "John Doe"}'
```

**Delete (DELETE)**:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/Customers(NEWCO) \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### 6. Handling Multiple Joins/Complex Queries

For complex queries involving multiple tables:

```json
"entity": {
  "CustomerOrders": {
    "source": {
      "query": "SELECT c.CustomerID, c.CompanyName, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, d.ProductID, p.ProductName, d.Quantity FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID JOIN `Order Details` d ON o.OrderID = d.OrderID JOIN Products p ON d.ProductID = p.ProductID"
    },
    "permissions": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "actions": ["read"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Access the view via:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/CustomerOrders?filter=CompanyName eq 'Alfreds Futterkiste'
```

### 7. Executing Stored Procedures

Configure stored procedure access:

```json
"entity": {
  "GetCustomerOrders": {
    "source": "GetCustomerOrders",
    "permissions": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "actions": ["execute"]
      }
    ],
    "parameters": {
      "CustomerID": "@CustomerID"
    }
  }
}
```

Execute the procedure:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/GetCustomerOrders?CustomerID=ALFKI" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### 8. Managing a Multi-Tenant Database

Implement multi-tenancy using row-level security:

```json
"entity": {
  "Customers": {
    "source": "Customers",
    "permissions": [
      {
        "role": "tenant-user",
        "actions": ["*"],
        "filter": "TenantID eq @claims.tenant_id"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this configuration, DAB automatically applies the filter using the tenant_id claim from the JWT token, ensuring users only access their tenant's data.

### 9. Scaling and Caching

**Scaling**:
- Deploy multiple DAB instances behind a load balancer
- Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for orchestration
- Configure horizontal scaling based on API traffic

**Caching**:
While DAB doesn't provide built-in caching, integrate with:
- Azure API Management for response caching
- Redis cache in front of DAB
- CDN for static content

### 10. Auto-Configuration Reload

To automatically detect changes in dap-config.json without restarting:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v $(pwd)/dap-config.json:/app/dap-config.json \
  mcr.microsoft.com/azure-databases-data-api-builder:latest \
  --watch
```

The `--watch` parameter enables file system monitoring, allowing DAB to reload configuration changes dynamically. 

### 11. Best Practices

1. **Security First**: Always use HTTPS, never expose DAB directly to the internet without API management
2. **Least Privilege**: Configure database accounts with minimal required permissions
3. **Environment Separation**: Use different configuration files for development, staging, and production
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for API usage patterns and errors
5. **Version Control**: Store dap-config.json in source control with proper review processes
6. **Validation Rules**: Define field validation rules in configuration to prevent invalid data
7. **Performance Testing**: Test complex queries under load before production deployment
8. **Backup Configurations**: Maintain backups of working configuration files

This guide is complemented by related resources, such as the "Modern Web App pattern for .NET" at [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/web-apps/guides/enterprise-app-patterns/modern-web-app/dotnet/guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/web-apps/guides/enterprise-app-patterns/modern-web-app/dotnet/guidance), which provides prescriptive architecture and code guidance, and a GitHub reference implementation at [github.com/Azure/modern-web-app-pattern-dotnet](https://github.com/Azure/modern-web-app-pattern-dotnet).

### How: Steps and Best Practices to Follow âœ…
To effectively learn or refresh knowledge using this guide, follow these structured steps:

1. **Understand Common Web Application Architectures**:
   - Begin with a single-project structure for simplicity, where all logic is contained in one project, compiled into a single assembly, and deployed as a unit. The guide details this in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures), showing file structures with folders for MVC models, views, controllers, data, and services.
   - As the application grows, consider splitting into multiple projects for better maintainability, separating UI, business logic, and data access into distinct projects.

2. **Apply Architectural Principles**:
   - Use **Separation of Concerns** to divide the application into distinct layers: Presentation (Controllers, Views), Business Logic (Services), and Data Access (Repositories, DbContext). This ensures maintainability and testability.
   - Follow **Dependency Inversion** to decouple components, using interfaces for communication, making the application more flexible and testable.
   - Design for **Scalability** and **Resilience** by implementing patterns like Queue-Based Load Leveling (asynchronous messaging with retry/removal, idempotent processing) and Retry (exponential backoff, using libraries like Polly), as detailed in the "Code guidance" section of the Modern Web App pattern.

3. **Choose the Right Azure Services**:
   - Use **Azure App Service** for hosting ASP.NET Core applications, offering built-in scaling and management features, as recommended in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/azure-hosting-recommendations-for-asp-net-web-apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/azure-hosting-recommendations-for-asp-net-web-apps).
   - Use **Azure SQL Database** for relational data storage, ensuring high availability and scalability.
   - Implement **Azure App Insights** for monitoring and diagnostics, capturing telemetry data for performance and error tracking, with guidance in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview).

4. **Develop the Application**:
   - Use **ASP.NET Core MVC** for building traditional web applications, leveraging controllers for request handling and views for rendering, as covered in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/develop-asp-net-core-mvc-apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/develop-asp-net-core-mvc-apps).
   - Leverage **Entity Framework Core** for data access, abstracting database operations for easier maintenance, with tutorials at [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).
   - Incorporate client-side technologies like Angular or React for rich user interfaces, with guidance in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-client-side-web-technologies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-client-side-web-technologies).

5. **Implement Security**:
   - Use **Authentication and Authorization** with ASP.NET Core Identity or Azure Active Directory, ensuring secure user access, as detailed in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/).
   - Protect against common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), with built-in features in ASP.NET Core, as noted in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery).

6. **Deploy and Manage**:
   - Use **Azure DevOps** or GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, automating deployment to Azure App Service, with examples in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/).
   - Enable **Autoscaling** in Azure App Service, setting rules based on metrics or queue length (e.g., 1 replica per 10 messages, max 5 replicas, min 0), as discussed in the Modern Web App pattern.
   - Monitor the application with **Azure App Insights**, configuring health checks and distributed tracing, with guidance in [learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks).

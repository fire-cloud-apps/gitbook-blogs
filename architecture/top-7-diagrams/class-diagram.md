# Class Diagram

## Class Diagram

### What is it?

A **Class Diagram** is a structural UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that represents the static structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, methods, and relationships between classes. It's used in object-oriented design to visualize the system's blueprint before coding.

***

### When to Use?

* During **system design phase** for object-oriented software.
* To model **real-world entities** (e.g., users, products, orders).
* To clarify **relationships** (e.g., inheritance, associations).
* To ensure **consistency** in system architecture.

***

### Real-Time Scenario Problem Statement

**Problem**: An e-commerce platform struggles with disorganized product inventory, inconsistent user data, and order processing errors. The team needs a clear system structure to avoid bugs and streamline development.

**Solution**: A Class Diagram will define core entities (e.g., `User`, `Product`, `Order`) and their relationships to ensure the system is logically structured.

***

### Use Case Examples

#### âœ… **Simple Use Case**: User Login System

**Scenario**: A basic login system with username/password validation.\
**Classes**: `User`, `LoginService`.\
**Relationship**: `LoginService` validates `User` credentials.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +id: int
        +username: string
        +password: string
    }
    class LoginService {
        +validate(user: User): boolean
    }
    LoginService -- User : uses
```

***

#### ðŸŸ  **Medium Use Case**: Shopping Cart System

**Scenario**: Users add products to a cart with quantity tracking.\
**Classes**: `User`, `Product`, `Cart`, `CartItem`.\
**Relationships**:

* `Cart` contains `CartItem` (composition).
* `CartItem` links to `Product`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +id: int
        +name: string
    }
    class Product {
        +id: int
        +name: string
        +price: float
    }
    class Cart {
        +id: int
        +items: CartItem[]
    }
    class CartItem {
        +quantity: int
    }
    Cart "1" *-- "0..*" CartItem
    CartItem "1" -- "1" Product
```

***

#### ðŸ”´ **Complex Use Case**: Full E-Commerce Platform

**Scenario**: End-to-end system with orders, payments, inventory, and user management.\
**Classes**: `User`, `Product`, `Order`, `Payment`, `Inventory`.\
**Relationships**:

* `Order` has multiple `Payment` entries.
* `Inventory` tracks stock for `Product`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +id: int
        +name: string
        +email: string
    }
    class Product {
        +id: int
        +name: string
        +price: float
    }
    class Order {
        +id: int
        +date: date
        +status: string
    }
    class Payment {
        +id: int
        +amount: float
        +method: string
    }
    class Inventory {
        +productId: int
        +quantity: int
    }
    Order "1" -- "0..*" Payment
    Order "1" -- "1" User
    Order "1" -- "0..*" OrderItem
    Inventory "1" -- "1" Product
```

### Comparison with Other Diagrams

| Diagram Type | Purpose                       | Focus                   | Class Diagram Comparison                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Use Case** | User interactions with system | Functional requirements | Shows _what_ the system does, not _how_.                           |
| **Sequence** | Object interactions over time | Dynamic behavior        | Class Diagram is **static**; Sequence shows **runtime flow**.      |
| **Activity** | Workflow/process steps        | Business logic          | Activity Diagram = process flow; Class Diagram = system structure. |

***

### In Summary

* **Class Diagram** = Static structure of a system (classes, attributes, relationships).
* **When to use**: Design phase for OOP systems.
* **Key benefit**: Prevents design flaws by clarifying entity relationships.
* **Best for**: Modeling complex systems (e.g., e-commerce, banking).

***

### Key Takeaway

Class Diagrams are the **foundation** of object-oriented design. They transform abstract requirements into a clear, actionable blueprintâ€”ensuring developers build systems that are scalable, maintainable, and error-resistant.

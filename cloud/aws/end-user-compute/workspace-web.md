Total Monthly Cost: ~$175.80 ($3.52 per user/month)
```

**Scenario 2: Enterprise (1,000 users)**

```
Monthly Usage: 1,000 users √ó 8 hours/day √ó 22 days = 176,000 session hours
Session Cost: 176,000 √ó $0.016 = $2,816
Data Transfer: ~$300/month
Additional Services: ~$100/month
Total Monthly Cost: ~$3,216 ($3.22 per user/month)
```

#### üí° Cost Optimization Strategies:

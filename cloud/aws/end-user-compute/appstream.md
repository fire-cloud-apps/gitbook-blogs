#### Sample Calculations:

**Small Design Team (10 users, 8 hours/day, graphics workload):**

* Instance costs: 10 √ó 8 √ó 22 √ó $1.93 = $3,396.80/month
* Storage (50GB/user): 10 √ó 50 √ó $0.023 = $11.50/month
* Data transfer (10GB/user/day): 10 √ó 10 √ó 22 √ó $0.09 = $198/month
* **Total**: \~$3,606/month

**Large Enterprise (100 users, mixed usage patterns):**

* Always-On instances (20): 20 √ó 24 √ó 30 √ó $1.44 = $20,736/month
* On-Demand instances (80): 80 √ó 6 √ó 22 √ó $0.72 = $7,603.20/month
* Storage (100GB/user): 100 √ó 100 √ó $0.023 = $230/month
* Data transfer: 100 √ó 15 √ó 22 √ó $0.09 = $2,970/month

## 📶 **Integrated Private Wireless on AWS (formerly AWS Private 5G)**

#### _The First Fully Managed, Cloud-Native 5G Network for Enterprises – Built for Industrial IoT, Smart Factories, and Mission-Critical Operations_

> ✅ **Updated 2025**: AWS has rebranded and enhanced **AWS Private 5G** as **Integrated Private Wireless on AWS**, now fully integrated with **AWS Outposts, Wavelength Zones, and Amazon Q**, delivering a **true end-to-end private 5G network** that runs on AWS infrastructure — no radios, no towers, no telecom expertise required.

***

### 🌟 **Overview**

**Integrated Private Wireless on AWS** is a **fully managed, cloud-native 5G network service** that enables enterprises to deploy **private 5G wireless networks** across campuses, factories, mines, ports, and stadiums — all powered by AWS infrastructure.

### ⚡ **Problem Statement**

#### 🏭 Real-World Scenario: Smart Factory with 10,000+ Connected Devices

**Company:** A global automotive manufacturer building a “smart factory” with robots, drones, AR/VR headsets, sensors, and autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs)\
**Challenge:**

* Existing Wi-Fi fails under high density (500+ devices per cell)
* Latency >50ms → AGVs can’t react fast enough
* No reliable connectivity for real-time video streaming
* Manual setup of radio frequencies causes interference
* High CAPEX: $2M+ for base stations, fiber, licenses

> ❗ Result: Production line delays, robot collisions, $3M+ in downtime.

***

#### 🤝 **Business Use Cases**

| Industry                          | Application                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manufacturing (Smart Factory)** | Real-time control of AGVs, robots, sensors           |
| **Mining & Oil & Gas**            | Secure, low-latency communication in remote sites    |
| **Ports & Logistics**             | Track containers, operate cranes, monitor safety     |
| **Stadiums & Events**             | Handle 100K+ users with seamless connectivity        |
| **Healthcare (Hospitals)**        | Enable AR/VR surgeries, real-time patient monitoring |

> 💡 Use Case Highlight:\
> A mining company uses **Integrated Private Wireless + Amazon Q** to ask:\
> &#xNAN;_“Why are my drones losing connection in Zone B?”_\
> → Returns: Low signal due to interference → auto-reassigned to new frequency.

### 👣 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Create a Private Wireless Network (via Console)**\
   → Go to **Integrated Private Wireless on AWS** → “Create Network”\
   → Choose name, region, and coverage area (e.g., 1km²)
2. **Define Network Slices**\
   → Create slices:
   * `RobotControl`: Ultra-low latency (<10ms), high reliability
   * `VideoStream`: High bandwidth, moderate latency
   * `SensorData`: Low power, long range
3. **Set Up Edge Compute (Optional but Recommended)**\
   → Deploy **Wavelength Zone** or **Outposts** in factory\
   → Run Lambda functions, AI models, or databases at the edge
4. **Register Devices (UEs)**\
   → Use **AWS IoT Core** to register:
   * AGVs
   * Drones
   * AR/VR headsets
   * Sensors
5. **Assign Devices to Slices**\
   → Map each device to its slice (e.g., AGV → RobotControl)
6. **Enable Monitoring & Alerts**\
   → Use **CloudWatch** for metrics (latency, throughput, errors)\
   → Set up alarms for failed connections
7. **Test with Amazon Q**\
   → Ask: _“Show me all devices in the RobotControl slice with high latency.”_\
   → Returns list → auto-recommended fix.
8. **Integrate with Applications**\
   → Send sensor data to **S3**, process with **Lambda**, analyze with **SageMaker**

### ⚖️ **When to Use and When Not to Use**

| ✅ When to Use                                  | ❌ When Not to Use                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| You have **100+ connected devices**            | You only have **a few Wi-Fi devices**        |
| Need **ultra-low latency (<10ms)**             | You’re okay with **50ms+ latency**           |
| Building **smart factories, mines, ports**     | You don’t care about **real-time control**   |
| Want **zero-trust, secure wireless**           | You prefer **open, unsecured networks**      |

### 💰 **Costing Calculation**

#### How It’s Calculated:

* **$0.05 per hour per network** ($36/month)
* **$0.01 per 1,000 devices connected**
* **$0.005 per GB of data transferred**
* **$0.0005 per 1,000 API calls**

> 📌 Example:
>
> * 1 network → $36
> * 5,000 devices → 5 × $0.01 = $0.05
> * 1 TB data → 1,000 × $0.005 = $5
> * 10K API calls → $0.50

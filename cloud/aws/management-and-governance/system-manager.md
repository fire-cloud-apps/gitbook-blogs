## AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

🛠️ **AWS Systems Manager – Unified Ops for Hybrid and Cloud Infrastructure (2025 Edition)**

***

### 🌟 Overview

**AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** is a unified operations hub that enables visibility and control over AWS and on-premises resources. It simplifies **configuration management**, **patching**, **automation**, and **compliance** across hybrid environments.

#### 🚀 Innovation Spotlight (2025)

* **SSM Agentless Management**: Manage EC2 and on-prem resources without installing agents.
* **OpsCenter AI Insights**: Integrated with Amazon Q for intelligent incident resolution.
* **Hybrid Activation Enhancements**: Seamless onboarding of on-prem servers with secure tunneling.
* **SSM Parameter Store + Secrets Manager Sync**: Unified secrets and config management.

***

### ⚡ Problem Statement

**Scenario**: A fintech company operates across AWS and on-prem data centers. They struggle with inconsistent patching, manual configuration drift, and lack of centralized visibility.

**Challenge**: Managing hybrid infrastructure securely and consistently without increasing operational overhead.

#### 2.1 🤝 Business Use Cases

* 🏦 Banking: Compliance-driven patching and audit trails.
* 🏥 Healthcare: Secure parameter storage and automation.
* 🏭 Manufacturing: Remote device management and diagnostics.
* 🧪 Pharma: Automated SOP enforcement via runbooks.

***

### 🔥 Core Principles

* **Unified Management**: Centralized control across AWS and hybrid environments.
* **Automation**: Runbooks, patching, and remediation workflows.
* **Compliance**: Inventory, change tracking, and audit logging.
* **Security**: Role-based access, encrypted parameters, and session isolation.

### 👣 Implementation Steps

1. **Create IAM roles** for Systems Manager access.
2. **Install SSM Agent** on EC2/on-prem (or use agentless mode).
3. **Register on-prem servers** via Hybrid Activations.
4. **Enable Inventory** to collect metadata.
5. **Configure Patch Manager** schedules.
6. **Create Automation documents** for tasks (e.g., restart service).
7. **Use Session Manager** for secure shell access.
8. **Store configs in Parameter Store** or Secrets Manager.
9. **Monitor via OpsCenter and CloudWatch**.
10. **Enforce config via State Manager**.

### 🔒 Security Measures

* 🔐 **IAM Roles**: Use scoped roles for each SSM feature.
* 🧪 **Session Manager**: Disable SSH, use encrypted sessions.
* 🛡️ **Parameter Store Tier**: Use Advanced tier for encryption and policies.
* 📜 **Audit Trails**: Enable CloudTrail for all SSM actions.
* 🔍 **Resource Tagging**: Enforce access boundaries via tags.

***

### ⚖️ When to Use and When Not to Use

#### ✅ When to Use

* Managing EC2 and hybrid infrastructure.
* Automating patching, config enforcement, and diagnostics.
* Secure shell access without network exposure.

#### ❌ When Not to Use

* Real-time monitoring (use CloudWatch).
* Deep application-level observability (use X-Ray).
* Managing non-AWS cloud resources directly.

***

### 💰 Costing Calculation

#### Pricing Factors

* Number of managed instances
* Advanced Parameter Store usage
* Automation executions
* Session Manager logs (stored in CloudWatch)

#### Sample Calculation

* **100 managed instances**
* **50 automation executions/month**
* **Advanced Parameter Store (10 secrets)**

→ Instance management: Free\
→ Automation: $0.002 per execution → $0.10\
→ Parameter Store: $0.05/secret/month → $0.50\
→ **Total: \~$0.60/month**

#### Efficiency Tips

* Use **basic Parameter Store** for non-sensitive configs.
* Schedule **automation** during off-peak hours.
* Use **tag-based targeting** to reduce scope.

> 🔥 **Innovation Spotlight (2025):**\
> AMG now includes **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**, **Auto-Generated Dashboards via Amazon Q**, and **Natural Language Query (NLQ) Support**.
>
> 🤖 Example:\
> You type: _“Show me CPU utilization spikes in production over the last 4 hours.”_\
> → AMG automatically:
>
> * Queries CloudWatch, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry
> * Detects anomalies using ML models
> * Generates a dynamic dashboard with root cause insights
> * Sends an alert via SNS if threshold breached
>
> ✨ This turns **observability from reactive to predictive and intelligent**.

> 💡 Also integrated with **Amazon Q for AWS** — enabling natural language interactions like: _“Why did my API latency increase at 3 PM?”_ → AMG answers with root cause analysis.

### ⚡ **Problem Statement**

#### 🏢 Real-World Scenario: Global FinTech Platform with Hybrid Workloads

**Company:** A global fintech firm running:

* AWS EC2 & RDS (prod)
* On-prem Kafka clusters (for transaction logging)
* EKS (Kubernetes) in AWS + Azure
* Third-party SaaS tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)

**Challenge:**

* Teams use **6+ different monitoring tools** (CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, etc.)
* No unified view of performance or incidents
* Critical issues take 2–4 hours to diagnose due to fragmented data
* Manual dashboard creation slows down DevOps velocity

> ❗ Result: Downtime during peak trading hours → $1M+ revenue loss.

### 🔒 **Security Measures**

✅ **Best Practices:**

* 🔐 **Use VPC Endpoints** to avoid public internet exposure
* 🔒 **Enable AWS SSO + MFA** for all users
* 🧹 **Apply least privilege IAM roles** (e.g., `GrafanaViewer`, `GrafanaEditor`)
* 🛑 **Disable direct root access**
* 📊 **Audit all activity via CloudTrail**
* 🔒 **Encrypt data at rest (KMS)** and in transit (TLS 1.3)
* 🔄 **Rotate API keys and secrets regularly**
* 🚫 **Never expose AMG workspace publicly** — always use private subnets

> 📌 Pro Tip: Use **Amazon Q for AWS** to ask:\
> &#xNAN;_“Who accessed the fraud detection dashboard last week?”_

***

### 🎯 **Innovation Spotlight: AI-Powered Observability (2025)**

Amazon Managed Grafana now includes **AI-driven anomaly detection** and **natural language query (NLQ)** powered by **Amazon Q**.

> 🤖 Example:\
> You type:\
> &#xNAN;_“Why did my database latency spike at 2:30 PM?”_\
> → AMG:
>
> * Cross-references CloudWatch, RDS Performance Insights, and application logs
> * Identifies a memory leak in a Lambda function
> * Generates a timeline with root cause
> * Suggests fix: “Scale Lambda memory to 2GB”

> 🚀 This transforms **observability from “what happened?” to “why did it happen?” and “how do I fix it?”**

> 🔥 Future: AMG will auto-generate **runbooks**, **automated remediation scripts**, and even **predict failure before it occurs**.

### ⚖️ **When to Use and When Not to Use**

| ✅ When to Use                                                      | ❌ When Not to Use                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| You need **unified observability** across AWS, on-prem, Azure, GCP | You only have **one data source** (e.g., CloudWatch only) |
| Teams want **self-service dashboards** without DevOps overhead     | You’re doing a **simple POC** with no long-term plan      |
| Need **AI-powered insights & anomaly detection**                   | You prefer **manual, low-level log parsing**              |
| Managing **multi-team, multi-environment** setups                  | You don’t care about **RBAC or collaboration**            |
| Want **serverless, zero-maintenance** visualization platform       | You want full control over Grafana binaries and patches   |

> ⚠️ Note: AMG is not a replacement for **application tracing** (use AWS X-Ray) or **log search** (use CloudWatch Logs), but a **unifying layer**.

***

### 💰 **Costing Calculation**

#### How It’s Calculated:

* **Per Workspace**: $0.10/hour ($73/month)
* **Per Data Source Connection**: $0.05/hour (optional)
* **Per GB of data processed**: $0.02/GB (only for external sources like Loki, Prometheus)

> 📌 Example:
>
> * 1 AMG workspace → $73/month
> * 3 data sources (CloudWatch, Prometheus, Loki) → 3 × $0.05 × 730 hrs = $109.50
> * 500 GB data processed → 500 × $0.02 = $10
>
> **Total Monthly Cost**: \~**$192.50**

> 💡 **Efficient Usage Tips:**
>
> * Use **data source filtering** to reduce processing cost
> * Set up **automatic retention policies** (e.g., delete logs after 30 days)
> * Use **Amazon Q** to reduce manual dashboard creation time
> * Delete unused workspaces immediately

> ✅ **Bottom Line**: Highly cost-effective for enterprises needing unified visibility.

Amazon EventBridge <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Arch_Amazon-EventBridge_64@5x (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> is a **serverless event bus service** that enables developers to build scalable, event-driven applications by connecting applications and services using events from various sources, including AWS services, integrated SaaS applications, and custom applications. It provides a powerful, flexible, and cost-effective way to route events between components, ensuring loose coupling, real-time processing, and robust automation.

***

### üîç **Problem Statement & Business Use Cases**

**Real-World Scenario**: An e-commerce company needs to process orders, update inventory, notify customers, and trigger marketing campaigns in real-time. Traditional monolithic architectures or point-to-point integrations lead to tight coupling, scalability issues, and operational overhead. EventBridge decouples these processes, allowing each service to operate independently while responding to events asynchronously.

**üè¢ Industries/Applications**:

* **E-commerce**: Order processing, inventory updates, and personalized marketing campaigns.
* **Healthcare**: Real-time patient data processing, compliance monitoring, and integration with EHR systems.
* **Finance**: Fraud detection, transaction processing, and automated compliance reporting.
* **IoT**: Real-time data ingestion from devices for analytics and alerting.
* **Multi-Account AWS Environments**: Centralized event management across accounts and regions for governance and security.

***

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Core Principles & Key Components**

EventBridge operates on **event-driven architecture (EDA)**, where systems communicate via events (JSON messages) indicating a change in state. Key components include :

* **Event**: A JSON message containing metadata (e.g., `source`, `detail-type`, `time`) and data (`detail`) about a state change.
* **Event Bus**: A router that receives events and delivers them to targets based on rules. Types include:
  * **Default Event Bus**: For AWS service events (e.g., S3 uploads, EC2 state changes).
  * **Custom Event Bus**: For custom applications or multi-tenant isolation.
  * **Partner Event Bus**: For SaaS integrations (e.g., Datadog, Zendesk).
* **Rules**: Filter events using pattern matching (e.g., `source: aws.s3` and `detail-type: Object Created`) and route them to targets. Each rule can support up to 5 targets.
* **Targets**: Services that process events, including AWS Lambda, SNS, SQS, Step Functions, and over 200 AWS services.
* **EventBridge Pipes**: Point-to-point integrations for filtering, enriching, and transforming events from sources like DynamoDB Streams or Kinesis.
* **EventBridge Scheduler**: Create, run, and manage tasks using cron or rate expressions (e.g., invoke Lambda every 5 minutes).

***

### üìã **Pre-Requirements**

* **AWS Account** with IAM permissions to create EventBridge rules, buses, and targets.
* **Event Sources**: Configure AWS services (e.g., S3, CloudWatch), SaaS applications, or custom applications to emit events.
* **Target Services**: Set up Lambda functions, SQS queues, or other AWS services to process events.

***

### üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Steps**

1. **Create an Event Bus**:
   * Use the default bus for AWS services or create custom buses for specific applications.
2. **Define Rules**:
   * Use event patterns (e.g., `{ "source": ["aws.s3"], "detail-type": ["Object Created"] }`) to filter events.
3. **Configure Targets**:
   * Attach targets (e.g., Lambda, SNS) to rules. For cross-account/region routing, use event buses as targets.
4. **Set Up Transformations**:
   * Use input transformers or EventBridge Pipes to modify event payloads before delivery.
5. **Enable Monitoring**:
   * Use CloudWatch Metrics and Logs to track event delivery and errors.

```

### üîí **Security Measures**

* **IAM Policies**: Control access to EventBridge APIs and resources using least-privilege principles.
* **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AWS KMS).
* **VPC Endpoints**: Securely access EventBridge from within a VPC without internet exposure.
* **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ)**: Handle failed events by routing them to SQS or SNS for reprocessing.

***

### üí° **Innovation Spotlight: Global Endpoints & Event Replay**

* **Global Endpoints**: Automatically fail over event ingestion to a secondary region during outages, minimizing data loss.
* **Event Replay**: Reprocess archived events for debugging, testing, or recovery from errors.
* **Schema Registry**: Automatically discover and store event schemas, generating code bindings for Java/Python to accelerate development.

### ‚öñÔ∏è **When to Use and When Not to Use**

| **When to Use**                                                                              | **When NOT to Use**                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decoupled Microservices**: Coordinate microservices without direct dependencies.           | **Simple Polling Tasks**: Use CloudWatch Events for basic scheduling.                             |
| **Real-Time Processing**: React to events instantly (e.g., S3 uploads, IoT data).            | **High-Throughput Streaming**: Use Kinesis for large-scale data streaming.                        |
| **SaaS Integrations**: Connect SaaS apps (e.g., Zendesk, Datadog) to AWS workflows.          | **Direct Service-to-Service Calls**: For synchronous communication (e.g., API Gateway to Lambda). |
| **Cross-Account/Region Routing**: Centralize event management in multi-account environments. | **Static Workflows**: Simple, linear workflows with no dynamic routing needs.                     |

***

### üí∞ **Costing Calculation**

* **Pricing Model**:
  * **Event Ingestion**: $1.00 per million events (for custom and partner events).
  * **AWS Service Events**: Free on the default bus.
  * **Schema Registry**: $0.10 per million events discovered and $0.10 per GB/month for storage.
* **Cost Optimization**:
  * Use **event filtering** to reduce unnecessary event processing.
  * **Archive and replay** only critical events to minimize storage costs.
* **Example Calculation**:
  * 5 million custom events + schema discovery for 1 million events = $5.00 + $0.10 = **$5.10/month**.

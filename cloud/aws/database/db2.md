### 9. ‚öñÔ∏è When to Use and When Not to Use

#### ‚úÖ When to Use:

* **Legacy Db2 Applications**: Migrating from on-premises Db2 without application changes
* **Enterprise Applications**: Mission-critical applications requiring ACID compliance
* **Complex Analytics**: Workloads requiring both OLTP and OLAP capabilities
* **High Availability Requirements**: Applications needing 99.99% uptime

### 10. üí∞ Costing Calculation

#### Cost Components:

1. **Instance Hours**: Based on instance class (e.g., db.m5.xlarge = $0.384/hour)
2. **Storage**: gp3 storage at $0.115/GB-month + IOPS costs
3. **Backup Storage**: First 100% of database size is free, then $0.095/GB-month
4. **Data Transfer**: Cross-AZ transfer at $0.01/GB, internet egress varies by region

#### Sample Calculation (US East - 1 month):

```
Instance: db.m5.xlarge (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM)
- Instance cost: $0.384/hour √ó 730 hours = $280.32

Storage: 1TB gp3 with 12,000 IOPS
- Storage cost: 1,024 GB √ó $0.115 = $117.76
- IOPS cost: (12,000 - 3,000) √ó $0.005 = $45.00

Backup: 500GB additional backup
- Backup cost: 500GB √ó $0.095 = $47.50

Multi-AZ: 100% additional cost for standby
- Multi-AZ multiplier: All above costs √ó 2

Total Monthly Cost: ($280.32 + $117.76 + $45.00 + $47.50) √ó 2 = $980.16
```

#### Cost Optimization Tips:

* Use Reserved Instances for 1-3 year commitments (up to 69% savings)
* Right-size instances based on actual utilization
* Use gp3 storage instead of io1 for better price/performance
* Implement automated start/stop for development environments
* Monitor backup retention and optimize as needed

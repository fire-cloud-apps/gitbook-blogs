🛠️ **Amazon Inspector – Agent-Based Assessment (Legacy)**\
🔐 _Deep Dive on the Deprecated Agent-Based Model & Evolution to Agentless Inspection_

***

### 🌟 1. Overview: What is Amazon Inspector (Agent-Based)?

🚀 **Amazon Inspector** was originally launched in 2015 as a security assessment service that helped identify vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices in AWS workloads. The **agent-based version** relied on installing a lightweight software agent directly onto EC2 instances to collect system-level data.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

📌 **Key Components of Agent-Based Inspector**:

* **Inspector Agent**: A small daemon installed on EC2 instances (Linux/Windows) that monitored network, process, file system, and configuration activities.
* **Assessment Targets**: Groups of EC2 instances tagged for inspection.
* **Assessment Templates**: Predefined or custom rules packages (e.g., CVE checks, CIS benchmarks).
* **Rules Packages**: Collections of security rules (e.g., "Security Best Practices", "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures").
* **Findings**: Generated post-assessment with severity levels and remediation guidance.

🔁 **Workflow Summary**:

1. Install Inspector Agent via SSM or user data.
2. Define tags to group instances into assessment targets.
3. Create an assessment template using one or more rules packages.
4. Run the assessment → Agent collects telemetry.
5. Amazon Inspector analyzes data and generates findings in the console.

🛑 **Important Update (as of May 2023)**:

> ⚠️ **AWS has deprecated the agent-based version of Amazon Inspector**. It reached end-of-life on **May 31, 2023**.\
> ✅ All new customers and existing users are now migrated to **Amazon Inspector (v3) – Agentless & Integrated with AWS Security Hub**.

🔄 **Modern Amazon Inspector (Current Version)**:

* No agents required.
* Uses **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** and **AWS Compute Optimizer** integrations.
* Automatically discovers EC2, ECR, and Lambda resources.
* Continuously scans for:
  * Software vulnerabilities (via Amazon Inspector scanner)
  * Network exposure risks (via Amazon Detective & EC2 Security Analyzer)
  * Hardening misconfigurations

🔍 Focus shifted from **periodic assessments** to **continuous, automated vulnerability detection**.

```

🔧 **Step-by-Step Implementation (Historical Context)**:

1. Enable Amazon Inspector in AWS Console.
2. Tag EC2 instances (e.g., `Environment=Production`, `Inspector=True`).
3.  Use SSM Run Command: `aws:runShellScript` to install agent:

    ```bash
    wget https://inspector-agent.amazonaws.com/linux/latest/install
    sudo bash install
    ```
4. Create **Assessment Target** using tag-based filters.
5. Build **Assessment Template** selecting rules packages.
6.  Schedule run via CLI or EventBridge:

    ```bash
    aws inspector start-assessment-run --assessment-template-arn arn:aws:inspector:...
    ```
7. Review findings → export → integrate.

### ⚖️ 4. When to Use — And When Not To Use

#### ✅ When to Use (Legacy Agent-Based Inspector – Historical)

| Scenario                                             | Reason                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| You needed deep host-level telemetry before 2023     | Agents gave low-level process/network/file monitoring |
| Required periodic CIS benchmarking                   | Rules packages included CIS Level 1/2 checks          |
| Offline or hybrid environments with SSM connectivity | Could still deploy agents on connected instances      |
| Needed integration with older Security Hub workflows | Supported pre-v3 finding formats                      |

#### ❌ When NOT to Use

| Scenario                                             | Why Avoid                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **New deployments after 2023**                       | Agent-based Inspector is deprecated; no support  |
| Looking for real-time, continuous scanning           | Legacy only supported scheduled runs             |
| Scanning containers or serverless functions          | Original Inspector didn’t support ECR/Lambda     |
| Want minimal operational overhead                    | Installing/maintaining agents adds complexity    |
| Need compliance with modern standards like ISO 27001 | Modern Inspector offers better evidence tracking |

🟢 **Use Modern Amazon Inspector Instead!**

> ✔️ Agentless scanning\
> ✔️ Continuous CVE detection\
> ✔️ Native ECR & Lambda support\
> ✔️ Integrated with AWS Security Hub & Amazon DevOps Guru

### 📝 Summary

✅ **Takeaway**:

> _"The legacy Amazon Inspector agent provided valuable host-based vulnerability assessments but has been sunsetted in favor of a modern, agentless, continuously scanning model that reduces operational burden and improves coverage across EC2, containers, and serverless."_

***

#### 🔑 Top 10 Things to Keep in Mind

1. **Agent-based Inspector is DEAD** — do not implement it in new systems.
2. Migrate all findings pipelines to **Amazon Inspector v3 (agentless)**.
3. Ensure **SSM Managed Instances Core** role is attached to EC2 for scanning.
4. Use **tags** to scope what gets scanned (avoid full account unless necessary).
5. Integrate findings into **AWS Security Hub** for unified view.
6. Enable **ECR image scanning** to catch container vulnerabilities early.
7. Combine with **AWS Config** for configuration drift detection.
8. Set up **EventBridge rules** to trigger alerts on critical CVEs.
9. Leverage **Insights** feature to track recurring issues.
10. Monitor **coverage percentage** in Inspector dashboard to ensure no blind spots.

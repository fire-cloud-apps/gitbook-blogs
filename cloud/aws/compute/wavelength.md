## AWS Wavelength: A Comprehensive Overview

### 1. 🌟 Overview

AWS Wavelength is designed to bring AWS services to the edge of 5G networks, enabling developers to build applications that require ultra-low latency by placing AWS compute and storage services at the edge of telecommunication providers’ networks. This allows for the rapid processing and delivery of data, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and real-time gaming.

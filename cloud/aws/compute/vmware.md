## VMware Cloud

### ü§î Overview of VMware Cloud on AWS

VMware Cloud on AWS is a jointly developed service that integrates VMware's Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) software with AWS's global cloud infrastructure. This service allows organizations to run their VMware environments on AWS, providing a consistent operational experience across on-premises and cloud environments. It is designed to simplify the migration, extension, and modernization of VMware workloads while leveraging AWS's scalability, security, and innovation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 1. Recent Changes in Availability and Sales

As of April 30, 2024, AWS and its channel partners no longer resell VMware Cloud on AWS. The service is now directly available through Broadcom or authorized Broadcom resellers. ¬∑ Existing customers who purchased subscriptions through AWS can continue to be invoiced by AWS until the end of their term but cannot renew or expand their subscriptions through AWS. They must transition to Broadcom for future purchases.

### üîç 2. Technical Capabilities and Features

VMware Cloud on AWS enables seamless migration and operation of VMware workloads on AWS infrastructure. Key features include:

Consistent VMware Environment: Customers can use familiar VMware tools like vSphere, vSAN, and NSX, ensuring compatibility and reducing the learning curve. ¬∑ Integration with AWS Services: The service allows integration with AWS services such as Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, Amazon RDS, and others, enabling hybrid cloud capabilities. ¬∑ Scalability and Security: Leverages AWS's global infrastructure, including 105 Availability Zones and compliance with 143 security standards.

### üí° 4. Alternatives and Migration Paths

AWS encourages customers to explore alternatives for VMware-based workloads, including:

Migration to Amazon EC2: Using services like AWS Application Migration Service to rehost VMware VMs on Amazon EC2, reducing costs and improving scalability. ¬∑ Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS): A newer AWS service that allows customers to run VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) on AWS with more control and flexibility. ¬∑ Modernization to Containers and Managed Services: Refactoring applications to use services like Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, or serverless options like AWS Lambda. ¬∑ AWS Outposts: For customers needing on-premises solutions, AWS Outposts runs AWS infrastructure and VMware workloads locally.

***

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. Support and Resources

AWS Support: AWS continues to support existing VMware Cloud on AWS customers until the end of their subscription terms. For new deployments, AWS offers tools like AWS Transform and Migration Hub to facilitate migration. ¬∑ Training and Certification: AWS provides training programs, such as "Migrating VMware Workloads to AWS," to help teams develop cloud skills. ¬∑ Partner Ecosystem: AWS Partners offer specialized services for migration, modernization, and managed operations.

### üíé Conclusion

VMware Cloud on AWS remains a viable solution for running VMware workloads on AWS, but its sales and distribution model has shifted to Broadcom. Customers should evaluate their options based on factors like control, flexibility, and long-term strategic goals. AWS provides robust alternatives, such as Amazon EVS and migration services, to ensure continuity and innovation for VMware-based workloads. For detailed guidance, customers can engage with AWS representatives or explore AWS's migration programs.

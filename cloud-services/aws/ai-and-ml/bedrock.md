### Security Measures 🔒

* **Data Encryption**: All data in Bedrock is **encrypted in transit and at rest** using AWS-managed keys. You can use customer-managed keys (CMKs) via AWS KMS for enhanced control .
* **Private Network Access**: Use **VPC Endpoints** (AWS PrivateLink) to keep all traffic between your VPC and Bedrock within the AWS network, never traversing the public internet .
* **Compliance**: Bedrock is **SOC, ISO, FedRAMP High, and HIPAA eligible**, making it suitable for handling sensitive data in regulated industries .
* **Data Privacy**: A core principle is that **Bedrock never uses your data to train its base FMs**. Your prompts, customizations, and data remain isolated and private .
* **Guardrails**: Configure Guardrails to block up to **88% of harmful content** and define denied topics and sensitive words to filter out inappropriate content in both inputs and outputs .

### Deep Dive: Advanced RAG with Knowledge Bases

The true power of Bedrock for enterprises lies in its implemented **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Unlike a simple vector search, a Bedrock Knowledge Base handles the entire pipeline:

1. It automatically **chunks your documents** into manageable pieces.
2. It generates **vector embeddings** using a chosen model (e.g., Amazon Titan Embeddings).
3. It stores these vectors in a managed **vector store** (e.g., Pinecone, Amazon OpenSearch).
4. During a query, it performs **semantic search** to find the most relevant chunks.
5. It strategically **injects this context** into the prompt sent to the FM.\
   This process **minimizes hallucinations** and ensures the model's responses are grounded in your proprietary data, providing accurate and context-aware results for users .

### When to Use and When Not to Use

| When to Use                                                                                                                    | When NOT to Use                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RAG Applications**: You need to build a Q\&A system grounded in your specific internal documentation or knowledge.           | **Simple Chat**: For a basic, generic chatbot without need for custom data, a simpler solution might suffice.                    |
| **Agent Workflows**: You need to automate multi-step tasks that involve reasoning, data retrieval, and action via APIs.        | **Full Model Training**: You need to train a large language model from scratch; consider Amazon SageMaker instead.               |
| **Multi-Model Strategy**: You want to experiment with and leverage multiple FMs from different providers through a single API. | **Low-Budget Projects**: For prototyping with very low or no budget, some open-source alternatives might be cheaper.             |
| **Enterprise Security**: Your use case requires high levels of security, compliance, and data isolation.                       | **Unstructured Workflows**: If your business processes are not defined or digitized, implementing AI agents will be challenging. |

### Costing Calculation 💰

* **How it's calculated?**
  * **Inference Costs**: Primarily **pay-as-you-go** based on **tokens processed** (input and output). Pricing varies by model . For example, Claude 3 Opus charges per 1K input and output tokens.
  * **Provisioned Throughput**: For predictable workloads, you can **commit to a term** for a discount, purchasing model capacity in exchange for lower per-token costs .
  * **Knowledge Bases & Storage**: Costs include the **hours of inference** for the embedding model, **vector store storage**, and **data processing** (e.g., OCR).
  * **Agents**: Priced based on **session duration** and the number of **agentic steps** performed .
* **Efficient Handling:**
  * Use **Provisioned Throughput** for production workloads with consistent traffic.
  * **Cache** common prompts and responses using services like Amazon ElastiCache.
  * Implement **prompt compression** and efficient filtering to reduce the amount of text sent to the model.
  * Use **appropriate model sizes**; a smaller, cheaper model might be sufficient for less complex tasks.
* **Sample Calculation:**
  * You process **5 million input tokens** and **2 million output tokens** with Claude 3 Sonna.
  * Input Cost: `(5,000,000 / 1000) * $0.00300 = $15.00`
  * Output Cost: `(2,000,000 / 1000) * $0.01500 = $30.00`
  * **Total Estimated Inference Cost: $45.00**
  * _Note: Add costs for Knowledge Base storage, vector querying, and agent steps if used._
